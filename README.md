# Multi-Sensor-DiffuserCam
The Multi-Sensor DiffuserCam project explores diffuser-based imaging systems with multiple sensors. This repository contains MATLAB scripts that interface with Zemax OpticStudio (here we are using version 17.5) allowing users to run analyses available in the OpticStudio suite on a lens file of their choice.
