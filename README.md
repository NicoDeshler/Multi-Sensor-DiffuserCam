# Multi-Sensor DiffuserCam
The Multi-Sensor DiffuserCam project explores diffuser-based imaging systems with multiple sensors. This repository contains MATLAB scripts that interface with Zemax OpticStudio allowing users to run analyses available in the OpticStudio suite on a lens file of their choice. In addition, the project Wiki offers a collection of resources designed to support users in setting up programmatic interfaces with Zemax, writing analyses, and creating multi-sensor configurations in their lens systems.
