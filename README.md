# Multi-Sensor DiffuserCam
The Multi-Sensor DiffuserCam project is an exploration in multi-sensor diffuser-based imaging systems designed to to extend the depth-of-field of conventional DiffuserCam setups. This repository contains MATLAB scripts that interface with Zemax OpticStudio and enable users to streamline data collection from simulated optical analyses on a a lens file. In addition, the project Wiki offers a collection of resources designed to support users in setting up programmatic interfaces with Zemax, writing analyses, and incorporating multi-sensor configurations in their lens systems.
